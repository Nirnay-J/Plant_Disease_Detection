#Plant_Disease_Detection
* Plant Disease is necessary for every farmer so we are created Plant disease detection using Deep learning. In which we are using Convolutional Neural Network for classifying Leaf images into 39 Different Categories. The Convolutional Neural is built using the Pytorch Framework. For Training we are using Plant village dataset.

#To run this project in your Local Machine You must have Python3.8 installed in your machine.
* Create a Python Virtual Environment & Activate Virtual Environment, Install all the dependencies using below command
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Go to the `App` folder.
* Download the pre-trained model file `disease_model_1.pt`
* Run the Flask app using below command `python3 app.py`
* You can also use downloaded file in `Model` Section and play with it using Jupyter Notebook.
